# Binary Search Tree

A **binary search tree** is a binary [tree](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/tree) where the nodes are ordered in a specific way. For every node:

- The nodes to the left are *smaller* than the current node.
- The nodes to the right are *larger* than the current node.

Checking if a binary tree is a binary *search* tree is [a favorite question from interviews](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/bst-checker).

Each child node to the left of the root contains integers less than 50, and each child node to the right of the root contains integers greater than 50.](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/bst__binary_search_tree.svg?bust=205)

#### Strengths:

- **Good performance across the board.** Assuming they're [balanced](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/tree#balanced), binary search trees are good at lots of operations, even if they're not constant time for anything.
  - Compared to a sorted [array](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/array), lookups take the same amount of time (**O(lg(n))\*O\*(\*l\**g\*(\*n\*))**), but inserts and deletes are faster (**O(lg(n))\*O\*(\*l\**g\*(\*n\*))** for BSTs, **O(n)\*O\*(\*n\*)** for arrays).
  - Compared to [unordered maps](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/hash-map), BSTs have better *worst case* performanceâ€”**O(lg(n))\*O\*(\*l\**g\*(\*n\*))** instead of **O(n)\*O\*(\*n\*)**. *But*, on average unordered maps perform better than BSTs (meaning **O(1)\*O\*(1)** time complexity).
- **BSTs are sorted.** Taking a binary search tree and pulling out all of the elements in sorted order can be done in **O(n)\*O\*(\*n\*)** using an in-order traversal. Finding the element *closest* to a value can be done in **O(lg(n))\*O\*(\*l\**g\*(\*n\*))** (again, if the BST is balanced!).

#### Weaknesses:

- **Poor performance if unbalanced.** Some types of binary search trees balance automatically, but not all. If a BST is not balanced, then operations become **O(n)\*O\*(\*n\*)**.
- **No \**O(1)\*O\*(1)\** operations.** BSTs aren't the *fastest* for anything. On average, [a vector](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/array) or [an unordered map](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/hash-map) will be faster.

## Balanced Binary Search Trees

Two binary search trees can store the same values in different ways:

![Two binary search trees: the one on the left is balanced and the one on the right is unbalanced. Both contain the same values: the integers 1 through 6.](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/bst__balanced_non_balanced.svg?bust=205)

Some trees (like AVL trees or Red-Black trees) rearrange nodes as they're inserted to ensure the tree is always balanced. With these, the worst case complexity for searching, inserting, or deleting is *always* **O(lg(n))\*O\*(\*l\**g\*(\*n\*))**, not **O(n)\*O\*(\*n\*)**.
